Simple splitscreen GSAK macro that shows the current filter on a google map

for now it is VERY basic, it just shows a red balloon for each cache.

TODO: (in no particular order)
* add different icons for different cachetypes
* add "bubble" with cache descriptions
* enable scrollwheel zoom
* center the map properly
* make maxShow userdefinable*
* when filter to large show the $maxShow nearest instead of the first $maxShow
